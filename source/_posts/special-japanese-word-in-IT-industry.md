My teammate told to me `APIをタタキましたか` and I don't get the ideas of what it means. It turns out he asked me whether I tried to call to the API.

<!-- more -->

`Call` in Japanese is `呼ぶ`, if you said `APIを呼び出す` I think Japanese will understand also. But actually they mostly say `APIを叩く`, which is `hits the API`. It quite strange to me, but it is language - people keep saying without thinking too much about the reason they are using it.

Found this page summarize this kind of new word, very informative.
