I am thinking for a passive income, that's why I added `Google Adsense` to my personal blog. But if user blocks the advertisement (by using adblock or something else), it means I receive nothing. 

That's why I will display a popup for reminding you to disable Adblock on my page.  

<!-- more -->

Actually I use the Adblock also, to keep focus on the reading because there're lots of page which have too much ads. But a minor ads in somewhere is acceptable also, that's why I am asking my reader to disable it.

I found solutions [here](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/detecting-an-ad-blocker-using-javascript-d488b794e5c7). The last one seems nice to me.

But it seems too much to me, I just need simple one. I already have `jQuery`, after some trying there's my finally source.

Have a brief explain in the gist above also.

Looking for my first 100 bucks (the limit of being able to withdraw from Google)
